ATM Management System
This project is a console-based ATM management system developed using Java. The system emulates an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) where users can perform basic banking operations.

Features:
User Authentication: Users can log in using their account credentials (account number and PIN).
Account Operations: After authentication, users can perform operations such as:
Check balance
Deposit funds
Withdraw funds
Mini Statement
Data Persistence: Simulated account data is stored in memory or a file, allowing basic data retrieval and manipulation.
Technologies Used:
Java (Core)
JDBC
Console-based user interface
Basic file handling or in-memory data storage
How to Run:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile and run the Java file containing the main program.
Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the ATM system.
Use predefined account numbers and PINs (if applicable) to log in and perform operations.
Purpose:
The project demonstrates fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming, user authentication, data management, and basic banking operations in a console-based environment.

Notes:
This project is developed for educational purposes and is a simplified representation of an ATM system.
Account data and functionality are simulated and not connected to a real banking system.
